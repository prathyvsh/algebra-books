My interest in algebra stems from the idea that Computational Structures share much
common ground with algebraic structures. This stems from the work of Eilenberg, Sch√ºtzenberger,
Chomsky, Minksy, et al. So my slant here is in understanding computational theory from the algebraic
perspective. Nevertheless, a general grounding in the subject would help one navigate the landscape easily.
So this is a limited curation, feel free to send a PR in case you know of other resources.

Book is a relatively short read that goes from the history of algebra to history of modern algebraic structures. In the end direction to create a course of teaching based on the historical evolution of the subject is given and caricatures of the eminent people involved in the industry of algebra is provided.
